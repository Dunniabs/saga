            At my current role, I'm deeply involved in architecting and developing robust and scalable applications, leveraging a suite of modern
            technologies. One of our key products is a SaaS app designed with Next.js and tRPC to ensure both optimal performance and ease of use. In
            parallel, I've spearheaded the creation of a blog generator, finely tuned with React Server Components and Next.js for seamless content
            delivery and performance.
          </span>
          <span>
            My workflow is supercharged by a DevOps ecosystem that includes AWS and Docker, focusing on CI/CD pipelines through Github Actions and
            CypressCI. For data management, I rely on Postgres paired with Prisma, while Postmark and Stripe handle our email and payment systems
            respectively. On the front-end, the experience is styled and animated using Tailwind and React, with Typescript ensuring code quality
            alongside Eslint and Prettier.
          </span>
          <span>
            Our codebase is hosted on GitHub, and we make extensive use of Vercel for deployment and analytics. Monitoring is done through Sentry, and
            OpenAI plays a part in some of our more advanced features. All these technologies are woven together in a seamless tapestry that lets us
            deliver high-quality products at scale.

            At Dunniabs, I operate as a freelance specialist focused on helping companies navigate the exciting world of decentralized applications
            (dApps). I primarily work with MultiversX and Ethereum platforms, utilizing Next.js and tRPC to create performant and scalable solutions.
            For Ethereum-specific needs, I leverage Rainbow Kit to ensure smooth interactions with the blockchain, while MultiversX Kit serves as my
            go-to toolkit for projects on that network.

            I bring my experience in Web3 technologies to build applications that not only meet but exceed client expectations, delivering both
            utility and innovation. My goal is to assist companies in unlocking the full potential of blockchain, ensuring seamless transactions, and
            secure, transparent operations.
