            At my current role, I'm deeply involved in architecting and developing robust and scalable applications, leveraging a suite of modern
            technologies. One of our key products is a SaaS app designed with Next.js and tRPC to ensure both optimal performance and ease of use. In
            parallel, I've spearheaded the creation of a blog generator, finely tuned with React Server Components and Next.js for seamless content
            delivery and performance.

          <span>
            My workflow is supercharged by a DevOps ecosystem that includes AWS and Docker, focusing on CI/CD pipelines through Github Actions and
            CypressCI. For data management, I rely on Postgres paired with Prisma, while Postmark and Stripe handle our email and payment systems
            respectively. On the front-end, the experience is styled and animated using Tailwind and React, with Typescript ensuring code quality
            alongside Eslint and Prettier.
          </span>
          <span>
            Our codebase is hosted on GitHub, and we make extensive use of Vercel for deployment and analytics. Monitoring is done through Sentry, and
            OpenAI plays a part in some of our more advanced features. All these technologies are woven together in a seamless tapestry that lets us
            deliver high-quality products at scale.
